The median age among those who quit was higher compared to those who did not (46 vs 42; p<0.001).\nOn univariate analysis, participants who did not quit smoking had higher rates of death (difference -4.9%; 95% CI -9.7%, -0.07%; p=0.037). However, on multivariable analysis, the relationship was not longer significant (odds ratio 0.90; 95% CI 0.64, 1.26)."

It will be expected that you can perform basic data manipulation. Experience with the {tidyverse} and the %>% operator is a plus, but not required."
