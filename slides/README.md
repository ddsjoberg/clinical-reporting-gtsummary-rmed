# Outline

## section 1

-   give an outline of the workshop
-   introduce the example we'll be completing together and review the aims of the study
-   give instructions on how to download the scripts
    -   should I also include the solutions in the same download? could be helpful in case anyone gets stuck, because the example builds on itself
    -   first exercise will be to apply column labels to the data frame

## section 2

-   introduce the trial data set
-   `tbl_summary()`
