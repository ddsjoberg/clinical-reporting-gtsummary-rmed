# Overview

The **gtsummary** package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in **R**. 
A critical part of the work of statisticians, data scientists, and analysts is summarizing data sets and regression models in R and publishing or sharing polished summary tables.
The **gtsummary** package was created to streamline these everyday analysis tasks by allowing users to easily create reproducible summaries of data sets, regression models, survey data, and survival data with a simple interface and very little code.
The package follows a tidy framework, making it easy to integrate with standard data workflows, and offers many table customization features through function arguments, helper functions, and custom themes.

## Learning objectives

Build, customize, and report tables often found in medical journals and other research-related publications.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make summary tables in R (data, survey data, regression models, time-to-event data, adverse event reports)?

-   Do you want your workflow to be reproducible?

-   Are you often frustrated with the immense amount of code required to create great-looking tables in R?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. 
It will be expected that you can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.

## Prework

Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R** 

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Most recent release of the **gtsummary** and other packages used in workshop.

    ```r
    install.packages(c("gtsummary", "tidyverse", "labelled"))
    ```
