# inline_text()

## {gtsummary} reporting with inline_text()

- Tables are important, but we often need to report results in-line in a report.

- Any statistic reported in a {gtsummary} table can be extracted and reported in-line in an R Markdown document with the `inline_text()` function.

- The pattern of what is reported can be modified with the `pattern = ` argument.  

- Default is `pattern = "{estimate} ({conf.level*100}% CI {conf.low}, {conf.high}; {p.value})"`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
tbl_uvreg
```

**In Code:** 
The odds ratio for age is `` `r "\u0060r inline_text(tbl_uvreg, variable = age)\u0060"` ``

**In Report:** 
The odds ratio for age is `r inline_text(tbl_uvreg, variable = age)`
